# Grand Notifier
Website + User Script combo that checks several pages and displays notifications when there are new messages/posts/etc. on one of those pages.
## How to use
Chrome, Chromium, Opera, and other Chrome-like browser users have to install [Violent monkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violent-monkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag) or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).

Firefox users have to install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).

After that just install [this User Script](https://tithen-firion.github.io/grand-notifier/javascripts/grand-notifier.user.js) and open [this page](https://tithen-firion.github.io/grand-notifier/). That's all.
